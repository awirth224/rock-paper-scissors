# Rock, Paper, Scissors
### Concept
This application is a game where a user can play rock, paper, scissors against a computer as many times as they would like. The wins for both players is kept below their names. A feature of the app is that the user can choose between a classic game or a difficult game which has two added options of 'lizard' and 'alien'. Lizard beats paper and scissors, and alien beats lizard and rock. Another feature is a button that allows you to change your game type from classic to difficult or visa versa after a round has been played. 


### Installation Instructions:
1. On your local machine, in your terminal, create a directory where you want to store the app.

3. Click the green 'code' button in towards the right and copy the SSH key.
4. Back in your terminal, go into the directory you created, type the command "git clone" and paste the SSH key in the same line/command.

### Learning Goals:
1. To write a player and game class that would contain all the properties and methods needed to play the game without the DOM.
2. To write an HTML page with only neccessary elements, classes and ids.
3. To write a CSS sheet to style the app in a user friendly and intuitive way.
4. To write a main.js document that updates the DOM using the data model.

### Wins + Challenges:
1. Racing against the clock. I lost some time I had alotted to working on the project because I was sick and needed to rest. This put a pressure I wasn't expecting on me but I was still able to get it done. 
2. Getting the board to reset after the game. There were many layers to get to the desired result. I had to break down the objective into small steps and address each one individually, oftentimes troubleshooting each one individually as well. For example, I first needed to clear the player's choices from the finished round. Once I did that, I needed certain icons to appear but it depended on which gameType the user selected. After that I needed to ensure that the icons visible were still clickable to play another round.
